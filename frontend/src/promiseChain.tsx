/*
promiseRunner is a helper to ensure that your browser isn't overloaded with
things. It returns a function with the signature (() => Promise) => Promise. When
called, it adds the callable to the task queue. The callables will be called,
in order; each callable should initiate some work and return a Promise
representing that work. The returned Promise waits for the callable to start,
then resolves with the result of the callable.
